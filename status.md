SHEEP HAPPENS

***

Short answers to the following questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have worked on the assets for the background and borders, the main character, the sheep, and the menu. I have also created a simple song for the main menu.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Adding some game mechanics and features.


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

To be honest, I had a really important personal problem that stopped me from making any progress on the project due to a lack of being able to concentrate on anything at all, so it is unfurtunate but I will hope to in this week, be able to finish something that it is at least playable and fun.
