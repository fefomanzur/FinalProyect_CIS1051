# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to create a simple video game with a Balatro-like structure

  - I was thinking of maybe doing a game where you are a starting farmer, and your farm is focus into having sheep because in this world wool was very valuable.
  - So this will be a turn-based game, where the enemies are going to be the predators, so coyotes, hyenas, wolves, and so on.
  - I also want to add special events like storms, blizzards, or surprise attacks, and on the other hand good events that i have to think about.
  - Also, for the game's progression, I want to have upgrades like better fences, guard dogs, traps, or the ability to breed rarer sheep.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't think I will be working with classmates

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How much of a game do you expect? Since I have 0 experience in video game creation, I'm just begging to learn with the CS50 videos. Also is it allowed
to watch tutorials about the things I don't know how to do?
