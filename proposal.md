# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

SHEEP HAPPENS

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a VideoGame, still debating between a Roguelike or a Story game

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be a videogame that will be written in Lua using Love2D and VScode and also I hope my game is enjoyable.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No for the moment.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not Applicable.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome will be a decent videogame with all the assets made by me, having unique game features and it is fully functional, with a menu screen. 

I will accomplish the main game, with decent designs and at least a (if story) finished story, (if roguelike) a decent loopable gameplay.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think that I can accomplish a enjoyable experience for the gamers, and as my first videogame I wish I could learn a lot of things from this experience and do a decent enough job.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope that I can finish this proyect as I want to, having done all the assets by myself and having a fun game either Roguelike or Story without any bugs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn Lua, Music theory and Art theory at a certain extain to be able to make the music and sprites by myself.
