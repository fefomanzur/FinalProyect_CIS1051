# FinalProyect_CIS1051
This is my final project for Introduction to Problem-solving and Programming in Python

On my submission I uploaded 2 videos, the first one is the voice over explaining my project, the difficulties, things I wasn't able to add, and all the things that I did for the project, for the second video is just the correct path of the labrinth with every sheep themes in the background.
